We wanted to build a 6-wheel rover, which would be equipped with various sensors and would be able to find the shortest route given a destination. We had the model ready, (shown in the attached image). Now we divided into two groups: One group will build the rover and the other will train it on simulation.",

After marking the rods we took out the metal cutter and cut the rods. The new club members were taught how to use the metal cutter. All safety precautions were followed including safety googles and gloves.",

The bolts we planed to use won't be enough so we put a request for purchase. Goal for next session - complete the basic structure of the rover.",
